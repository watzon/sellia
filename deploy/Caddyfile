# Sellia Caddyfile - Automatic HTTPS with On-Demand TLS
#
# On-demand TLS obtains certificates for each subdomain as they're accessed.
# This avoids the DNS-01 challenge required for wildcard certificates.

{
    # For production, add an 'ask' endpoint to verify valid subdomains:
    # on_demand_tls {
    #     ask http://sellia-server:3000/tunnel/verify
    # }
}

# Catch-all HTTPS handler for all subdomains
https:// {
    tls {
        on_demand
    }
